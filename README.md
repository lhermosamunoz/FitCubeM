# FitCubeM
The code performs a fit to the spectra of a data cube. It requires the data to be in txt format. 
The original non-parallelized code is "lines_recop_all_2.py" which has been splitted into several codes.
The main code to run is "RunFits.py" and all the needed plots and final results are obtained by running "Recop.py"
